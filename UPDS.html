      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>
        The United Persons with Disabilities (UPWDs) is a community-based organization (CBO) for and by people
        with disabilities established in 2020 in Bweyogerere parish in Uganda to support people living with
        disabilities (PWDs) progress to more sustained livelihoods through meaningful engagement in social
        entrepreneurship. The organization has a vision of empowering a total of 500 people with disabilities to live
        independent and meaningful lives by January 2027 by offering opportunities for self-employment. Our work
        is guided by our mission “To empower people with disabilities to contribute to community development by
        providing them access to employment opportunities.”</p>
        <h1>OUR OBJECTIVES ARE :</h1>
        <p>1. To support people with disabilities progress to sustained and meaningful employments through
        social entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>2. To provide training and tailored mentorship in core business management aspects such as finance,
        planning and venture creation.</p>
       <p> 3. To provide capacity for businesses owned and managed by people with disabilities to gain from
        government Special Grant and business creation schemes such as Social Assistance Grant for
        Empowerment (SAGE), Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Program (UWEP), Youth Livelihood
        Fund (YLP), Emyooga, and Parish Development Model (PDM).</p>
        <h1>OUR THEORY OF CHANGE</h1>
        <p>a holistic community development is not a one man’s efforts, instead, it
        arises from many dimensions of influence and empowerment shaped by appropriate and equal distribution
        of resources, power and voice. Our assumption is that empowering people with disabilities to identify and
        utilize opportunities in entrepreneurship can achieve both social integration and economic empowerment.
        This ensures that all people regardless of disabilities are fully engaged in the community development
        processes, and are valued, and treated with DECORUM.</p>
      <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
      <p>A thriving community of empowered
        individuals with disabilities, driving positive
        change and progress in their communities</p>
      <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
      <p>Transforming lives by empowering 500
        people with disabilities towards selfsufficiency
        and purposeful living by
        January 2027</p>
      <h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
      <p>Our goal is to position UPWDs as a benchmark for contemporary disability organizations, characterized not by our weaknesses, but by our commitment to empower and support individuals we serve, enabling them to succeed.</p>
