          <p>
            The United Persons with Disabilities (UPWDs) is a community-based organization (CBO) for and by people 
            with disabilities established in 2020 in Bweyogerere parish in Uganda to support people living with 
            disabilities (PWDs) progress to more sustained livelihoods through meaningful engagement in social 
            entrepreneurship. The organization has a vision of empowering a total of 500 people with disabilities to live 
            independent and meaningful lives by January 2027 by offering opportunities for self-employment. Our work 
            is guided by our mission “To empower people with disabilities to contribute to community development by
            providing them access to employment opportunities.”

            <h3>OUR OBJECTIVES</h3>
            Our objectives are:
1. To support people with disabilities progress to sustained and meaningful employments through 
social entrepreneurship.
2. To provide training and tailored mentorship in core business management aspects such as finance, 
planning and venture creation.
3. To provide capacity for businesses owned and managed by people with disabilities to gain from 
government Special Grant and business creation schemes such as Social Assistance Grant for 
Empowerment (SAGE), Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Program (UWEP), Youth Livelihood 
Fund (YLP), Emyooga, and Parish Development Model (PDM).

            <h3>OUR THEORY OF CHANGE</h3>
            <p>a holistic community development is not a one man’s efforts, instead, it 
              arises from many dimensions of influence and empowerment shaped by appropriate and equal distribution 
              of resources, power and voice. Our assumption is that empowering people with disabilities to identify and 
              utilize opportunities in entrepreneurship can achieve both social integration and economic empowerment. 
              This ensures that all people regardless of disabilities are fully engaged in the community development 
              processes, and are valued, and treated with DECORUM</p>
